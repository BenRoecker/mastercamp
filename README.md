Hi, this is our projet for the MasterCamp (Summer 2021) in Efrei Paris. This is a project for the digitalisation of the prescription on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
You'll also need to install ganache and the chrome extension : Metamask.  
Once Ganache install, you'll need to create a new ethereum workspace. You will need to add the file called truffle-config.js to the projet.  
The Ganache server Port Number needs to be 8545, if not you can change it in the parameter --> server --> PORT NUMBER.  
Restart the project and click on the key of the first adress, copy the Private Key (You will need it for metamask).  
Well Done you have configured you're private blockchain.

Now you can open Chrome or firefow and install Metamask extension. One done, you'll have to create a account.  
Now you can import one of the wallet generated by Ganache by importing a wallet with the private key you just copy. It should say that you have 100 ETH.

```
npm install vuex
npm install -g truffle
truffle console
````
In the truffle console you can type now :
```
migrate --compile-all --reset
```
This command will deploy our smart contract on the blockchain.   

Congratulation ! you can start using our projet.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
